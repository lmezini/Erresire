Erresire enables users to simulate large populations of strong graviational lenses in an efficient and flexible manner via monte carlo method.
Users can customize the simulation by inputing their catalogs of choice for dark matter halos, galaxies and sources.

For usage example, refer to the notebook model_run_example.ipynb.
